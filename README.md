## About the project
This is a simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the JavaFX library for UI and FXGL (a game development library) for game mechanics. The purpose of the project was to gain hands-on experience with Java-based game development and apply object-oriented programming principles, as well as learning about the build automation tool Gradle

## Features
- **Infinite obstacles**: Fly through an unending series of randomly generated pipes!
- **Collision detection**: Ends the game when the bird collides with any surface
- **Score tracking**: Displays the player's score during the game

## Technology stack
- **Java 17**: Core programming language
- **JavaFX**: Used for building the user interface and handling graphics
- **FXGL**: A game engine built on JavaFX for handling game-specific mechanics like physics, collisions, and animations.

## How to run
### Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher
2. **OS: Windows**: No support for other OS as of now

### Steps

1. Download the release from this Github page
2. In the command line/terminal, navigate to the folder containing the .jar file
3. Type `java -jar FlappyBirdClone-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Gameplay instructions
- Press space to make the bird fly upwards
- Try to pass through as many pipes as possible!

## Learning objectives
- **Game development basics**: Understand how to create game logic, manage game states, and handle animations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Apply principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Physics simulation**: Implement gravity and collision detection using FXGL.
- **Gradle**: Learn about Gradle and learn how it can automate developer tasks

## Future improvements
1. High score tracking
2. Background music
3. Docker integration


## Acknowledgements
- **JavaFX and FXGL**: For providing excellent resources to learn from.
- **The original flappy bird**: Inspiration for this project
